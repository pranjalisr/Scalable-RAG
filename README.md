Scalable RAG

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed for scalability, modularity, and performance. This project demonstrates how to build an AI system that can ingest large-scale data, index efficiently, and serve low-latency responses using modern vector databases, LLMs, and orchestration frameworks.

ðŸš€Features

Scalable Ingestion: Handles large document sets with batch and streaming pipelines.
Efficient Retrieval: Uses vector search + metadata filtering for context-aware results.
LLM Orchestration: Flexible support for OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models.
Caching & Reranking: Optimized retrieval with rerankers and caching layers.
Extensible Architecture: Pluggable modules for embeddings, retrievers, and LLMs.
Production-Ready: Includes monitoring hooks, evaluation utilities, and deployment configs.
